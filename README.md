# International Waste Shipments (IWS) Online Prototype

A repository for Environment Agency IWS online prototype. It contains experimentation of possible ideas and alternatives for the IWS online service.

The content in this repository is draft status. It is not intended for wider public use and only to support the development of the IWS online service.

## GOV.UK Prototyping Kit

These prototypes are built using the [GOV.UK Prototyping Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit).

>The kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on GOV.UK.*

The majority of the code and documentation comes from there, with just our own prototype designs being specific to this project.

The installation and execution instructions are also reproduced from there. If you are intending to build your own prototypes for inclusion on [GOV.uk](www.gov.uk) we suggest you start there rather than with this project.

## Installation instructions

**Please note.** The following links point to documents provided as part of the GOV.UK prototyping kit.

## Hot reload

Any code changes should update in the browser without you needing to restart the app.

The app recompiles `app/assets/sass/application.scss` every time changes are observed.

## Contributing to this project

We do not expect contributions as this project is for prototyping a specific service only. However if you have something you'd like to contribute please log an issue.
